## Overview
### Brief
The brief for this application is the following: To efficiently deploy a simple Flask application making use of a range of tools. 
### Requirements
The requirements for the application are the following:
- A Jira board with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
- This could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.
- The application must be deployed using containerisation and orchestration tools.
- The application must be tested through the CI pipeline.
- The project must make use of two managed Database Servers: 1 for Testing and 1 for Production.
- If a change is made to the code base, Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application.
- The infrastructure for the project should be configured using an infrastructure management tool (Infrastructure as Code).
- As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your CI Server needs to run.
- The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.
